This repository demonstrates a common PHP error: accessing an array element using a non-existent key.  The `bug.php` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version.  The error manifests as an undefined index notice or error, halting script execution or producing unexpected results. This example highlights the importance of checking for key existence before accessing array elements.

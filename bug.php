This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to undefined array keys.  It attempts to access an array element using a key that doesn't exist, resulting in an undefined index error or a notice depending on PHP's error reporting level.

```php
<?php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];

echo $myArray['c']; // This will cause an error or notice.
?>
```
